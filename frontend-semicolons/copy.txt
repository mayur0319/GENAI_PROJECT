**Type 2 Diabetes: A Comprehensive Guide**

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects how the body converts glucose, a sugar that comes from food, into energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose enter cells in your body for energy.

**Symptoms:**

* Increased thirst
* Frequent urination
* Weight loss
* Fatigue
* Blurred vision
* Slow-healing sores
* Frequent infections
* Tingling or numbness in your hands or feet

**Risk factors:**

* Obesity
* Family history of diabetes
* Age 45 or older
* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Physical inactivity
* Certain ethnicities, such as African American, Hispanic American, American Indian, and Asian American

**Diagnosis:**

Your doctor will diagnose type 2 diabetes with a blood sugar level test. A blood sugar level test measures the amount of glucose in your blood. Your doctor may order a fasting blood sugar level test, a random blood sugar level test, or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test.

**Treatment:**

There are several treatments for type 2 diabetes, including:

* Medicine

**Medications:**

There are a variety of medications that can help lower blood sugar levels. These medications include:

* Oral medications, such as metformin, glyburide, and sulfonylureas
* Injectable medications, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and insulin

**Diet:**

A healthy diet can help lower blood sugar levels. You should eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You should also limit your saturated fat and cholesterol intake.

**Exercise:**

Regular exercise can help lower blood sugar levels. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.

**Insulin:**

Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose enter cells in your body for energy. If your blood sugar levels are not controlled with medication and diet, your doctor may prescribe insulin.

**Prevention:**

There are several things you can do to help prevent type 2 diabetes, including:

* Maintain a healthy weight
* Get regular exercise
* Eat a healthy diet
